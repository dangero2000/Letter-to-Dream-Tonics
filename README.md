# Letter to Dream Tonics

An open letter to Dream Tonics inquiring about accessibility for their vocal synth program, Synthesizer V.

## What is a vocal synth program?

Vocal synth programs are designed to simulate a human singer. This has a wide variety of applications. For instance, you can use a vocal synth to help a human singer figure out how to sing your song or as a temporary replacement until your singer can come in to do the recording. Of course, vocal synths are an excellent alternative for producers if they want to have a singer in their song, but they can't sing themselves and can't find a human singer. Given they aren't real singers, vocal synths also have a lot more flexibility than a human singer in certain aspects. This means you can make them sing as fast as you want or use vocal tricks that humans wouldn't be able to do naturally to give your song a unique feel.

## What is Synthesizer V, and What Makes It Special?

Synthesizer V is a vocal synth program, just like many others. What sets it apart is its use of AI, while most other vocal synth programs use concatenative synthesis.

Concatenative synthesis is when someone records a human's voice and then splits the different sounds apart using an audio editor. The vocal synth program then combines these sounds together to synthesize singing. The process of sampling a human's voice for concatenation can take several hours of audio in order to sound good. This isn't always the case if the conditions are right, but it can still be difficult to make a good concatenative voice.

With Synth V, the AI annalizes the singer's voice down to the tiniest detail, then reconstructs it based on the notes and lyrics the user provides. This results in a sound that is typically a lot cleaner than concatenative synthesis.

In Synth V's case, it is one of the few AI-based vocal synths on the market. Though there are others, either their AI voices are less clean-sounding or the programs in question don't have as many features. What truly sets Synth V apart from the other AI-based programs is the extent to which you can customize it using its plugin system, as well as the parameters it provides to make your singer sound as realistic as possible.
